				text: "<p>I was slow to the MP3 leak game, so I ended up reading a lot about the <em>The College Dropout </em>before I ever heard it. Most of the advanced reviews were similar, hailing West as a dynamic producer with more hooks than Bass Pro, but paying little attention to his ability as a rapper. So when the \"All Falls Down\" music video dropped in early 2004 and I was exposed to Kanye for the first time, I remember being surprised by the stand-out lyricism. I was instantly attracted to the conflicting points of view, and how effortlessly his focus could switch from reflective apprehension (\"And for that paper, look how low we stoop\") to self-assured hubris (\"Fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou\"). The song is a rare example of Ye working things out; uncertain of his angle, but as determined as ever in his delivery.</p> <p>Putting it against \"Spaceship,\" another highlight of the album’s first half, seems fitting, if a little unfair. Centered on a sped-up sample of Marvin Gaye's serene \"Distant Lover,\" \"Spaceship\"’s beat is among Kanye's most measured and soulful, creating a lush and atmospheric instrumental as good as anything on <em>TCD</em>. But the abrasiveness of his raps seem at odds with the composure of the production, and at the end of the day, \"Spaceship\" can't match \"All Falls Down\" in ambition or antagonism, resulting in a work that's thoroughly enjoyable, but unexceptional.</p> <p> - Kyle Fulton </p>"

				text: "<p>Depending on your opinion of Kanye, \"We Don't Care\" could either be viewed as the artist at his most thoughtful or his most Machiavellian. From the first revelation (\"If this is your first time hearing this, you are about to experience something so cold\"), West is on a calculated mission to convert, announcing each phrase with the gravity of an epiphany, but also the poise to make it clear that this song, and album, are simply an affirmation of his preordained greatness. But what makes this track momentous enough to rank alongside other great album opening manifestos (\"The Ruler’s Back,\" \"Excursions,\" \"Liquid Swords\") isn't its cocksure swagger, but its long term vision. \"We Don't Care\" is his musical prototype, a grand design that he would continue to build and elaborate on over the first half of his career. It's not his best track, rather the genesis of this century's most acclaimed body of art, making it arguably his most important. </p> <p>If \"We Don't Care\" is a candidate for Kanye's most conscientious song, then \"Touch the Sky\" is surely one of his more cursory. It's his \"Diddy track,\" and I mean that in the best way possible. Built around the hook of an established Curtis Mayfield classic, and flush with first-rate rhymes (\"I felt like Bad Boy's street team, I couldn't work the Lox\"), West succeeds in making one of his top radio- friendly tracks, which also ranks among his most one-dimensional. Maybe it’s the safety of the Just Blaze production, or the fact that Lupe Fiasco never lived up to the hype, but \"Touch the Sky\" hasn't aged as well as I would have guessed while watching Kanyevil stunt in 2006 . It's a hit to be sure, but it lacks the audacity of Ye's best work, making it an easy first round upset.</p> <p> - Kyle Fulton </p>"

No one roots for Goliath, but there is a reason \"Slow Jamz\" feels like it was under-seeded by the selection committee and it proves that by surgically picking apart \"Hey Mama\"'s defense to advance easily into the Round of 32. \"Hey Mama\" should not be sold short—it is a ballad dedicated to Ye's mother, Donda West, and it beautifully describes his affection for her with a raw sentimentality rarely seen in rap. The song took on even more meaning for Ye personally after his mother’s passing a few short years after it’s release. But that personal connection cannot overshadow the importance of \"Jamz\" being Yeezy’s first number one single. Q magazine named it as the nineteenth greatest hip-hop song of all time—hyperbole, yes, but a sign of how beloved it still is within West’s overall catalogue. In many ways, the sped-up soul sample work on \"Jamz\" defines our memory of Kanye’s early sound as an artist, and it's the signature song that put him on the radio/pop landscape. \"She got a light-skinned friend, look like Michael Jackson./ Got a dark-skinned friend, look like Michael Jackson\" is the fast break off-the-glass alley-oop that puts this one out of reach.</p> <p> - Trevor Smith </p>"

It’s a tribute to his label Roc-A-Fella over one of his most soulful and relaxed productions and my favourite when I want to hear some of that early Kanye. After two verses of the Louis Vuitton Don on top, at award shows wearing designer cologne, all glasses are raised. The rapping stops, but the beat continues for Kanye West to tell ‘em the Kanye West story, in detail. He gets evicted and moves with his mom to New Jersey, he tracks \"Heart of the City\" for Jay-Z, he builds some IKEA furniture, his deal falls apart with Capitol records so he makes his home at Roc-A-Fella. The rest is history. Long before he was interrupting award shows, Kanye knew how to thank those who had helped him get to where he was, and man did he know how to use that AKAI sampler.</p> <p> - Daniel Hernandez </p>"

Both \"Coldest Winter\" and \"Stronger\" are a musical mosquito itch, touching on something that’s already there to visceral effect. And while \"Coldest Winter\" achieves an arguably more original sonic picture, \"Stronger\" is as close as Kanye gets to photo-realism. </p> <p>\"Coldest Winter\" is a song about leaving something behind. \"Stronger\" is so present it’s almost prescient. \"Coldest Winter\" asks the listener to linger on an old wound, but \"Stronger\" propels its audience forward. Kanye’s reputation that he doesn’t play well with others has always been belied by his catalogue and while neither \"Coldest Winter\" nor \"Stronger\" refit their respective samples (Tears for Fears’ \"Memories Fade\" and Daft Punk’s \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\") in a particularly dramatic way, both songs exploit the emotional strength of the work they sample to virtuoso cathartic effect. </p> <p>But, while \"Coldest Winter\" is a note-perfect example of Kanye’s ability to craft a stark emotional landscape within a pop song, \"Stronger\" is a relentless reminder that he’s better at creating music you want to listen to than almost anyone else. </p> <p> - Haley Cullingham </p>"

I remember \"Amazing\" to be a refreshingly hype track in a dour patch late on that album.

This is one of the most cathartic songs I’ve ever heard. Whenever I listen to the opening bars my heart starts racing and, it sounds corny but, I feel like I can do anything. I saw him perform this live and cried actual tears of joy. Even though he is talking about stuff that happens in his life that I couldn’t possibly relate to, this song is actually super relatable. \"I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny / And what I do, act more stupidly.\" Like, even if this feeling isn’t followed by me buying hella Louis V, this sentiment is pretty damn universal.</p> <p>\"Good Morning\" is a pretty great way to open up an album. Listening to it always felt like Kanye was saying \"wake up!\" not just to the listener, but also to himself, which is sort of in line with the feeling of <em>Graduation</em>, like, hey, what now? You’re famous, what now? This is a great song, but not one that I always remember when I think of Kanye songs that I love.

All this, over a chopped-up vocal sample from STEELY DAN’S \"Kid Charlemagne,\" a song named after a king who is credited with not only getting modern France and Germany started but also uniting most of Western Europe? Who else but Ye would fancy themselves the King Charlemagne of rap? With this in mind, turn on \"Love Lockdown\" and take solace in learning that even King Charlemagne gets his heart stomped on. This is a pre-Kim universe, where Ye has captured that sterile, colourless world of heartbreak. He’s too despondent to rap. He’s gotta turn to auto-tune, and layer his mechanized self overtop a menacing heartbeat/drumbeat.

Ghostly choral voices swell, punctuated by digitized bleeps and Kanye’s now-familiar auto-tuned vocals. I sat in disbelief as this new sonic texture took shape. Kanye was breathing a rarefied air, carving out a place for himself alongside MJ, Prince, and Radiohead—those fearless pioneers who refuse to be defined by their peers’ expectations.

Part of its glory lies in the context of that particular time in Kanye's career.

In the light of his Master Work (<em>Yeezus</em>), we now know just how much the 2008 Kanye West wanted (and needed) to transcend the confines of the artistic cubicle in which he'd been placed. \"Say You Will\" marks the beginning of his forays into uncharted creative waters, when he made a conscious decision to not give a fuck.

It gives one pause, and that’s precisely Kanye’s intent here—this is music’s best artist today at the peak of his powers, as a musician and as a pop culture provocateur (/engineer?). Production-wise, this is sheer mastery, and Hudson Mohawke may in fact be the behind-the-curtains MVP of <em>Yeezus</em>, the best album of this decade at its halfway mark.</p> <p> Adam Cook </p>"

				text: "<p>For all the talk of Kanye’s alleged egotism, he is nothing if not a great connector of worlds. The most grandiose examples of this appear in his <em>My Dark Beautiful Twisted Fantasy</em>/G.O.O.D. Friday extended posse cuts. \"Christian Dior Denim Flow\" is a paradigmatic example: the progressions, the strings and electric guitars, the all-star line up of singers blended together into the hook, most memorably the very eclectic sources for the verses (in case you forgot what 2010 was like, Lloyd Banks was having an almost-comeback and Ryan Leslie was almost popping). The song certainly maintained the mammoth excitement building up to the album, but Kanye was right to keep it off the track list. It’s almost seven minutes long, and none of his collaborators shine enough to make this feel like anything more than a snapshot of the time.</p> <p>The opening bars of \"No Church in the Wild\" are driven by that distinct, ominous bass line, until the luminous voice of Frank Ocean appears, speaking of gods and men. The song sets the tone perfectly for an album about rappers who have become titans of their industry, who live in the most expensive hotel rooms and collect priceless art. While Jay-Z’s verse is an acrobatic clash of classical and Christian themes, it’s Kanye’s nihilistic tale of sex and drugs that stands out. Who can’t relate to the bittersweet feeling of chasing a high? It’s this type of expressed vulnerability that makes Kanye so appealing: even rap gods get hangovers.</p> <p> - James Rathbone </p>"

				text: "<p>Perhaps one of the most lyrically poignant songs Kanye has ever created, \"Murder to Excellence\" is a two-part acknowledgement of African-American presence in crime and the lack thereof in America's wealthy elite. Kanye and Jay directly address the black man in \"Murder,\" making a plea for him to stop perpetuating violence (\"I'm out here fighting for you, don't increase my stress-load\"). In contrast, \"Excellence\" celebrates Kanye and Jay's success while simultaneously lamenting that they are representing a minority. The song, which includes a repeating \"La La La\" sample from Indiggo, opens with \"bloody murder\" and ends with \"black excellence, truly yours,\" a powerful discourse. On the other hand, \"White Dress\" is a love letter. Kanye describes his now-betrothed and envisions their future together; the song is definitely sweet, and yet it contains a twinge of melancholia. The piano-heavy accompaniment is smooth and simple; the resulting effect is one of nostalgia. In many ways, \"White Dress\" is uncharacteristic; it is a departure from Kanye's typical lavish, layered musical productions. The intimacy he allows between him and his listener is refreshing, and for that reason, \"White Dress\" is a winner. </p> <p> - Sonali Mehta </p>"

				text: "<p>There is a Legendary Kanye who exists as a 20-something dreamer, floating around the metropolitan Chicago area just after the turn of the millennium. He's a journeyman in a pink polo, sporting a backpack full of old soul tapes and cartoon teddies. This Ye of our invention was the one who produced tracks like \"Home,\" and \"U Know,\" and \"Gone\" (which still feels criminally underrated). He was just trying to get one beat on his idol, and the purity of this pursuit has given his output from this era an ingenuity that feels honest, and real, and true. </p> <p>The evolution of Kanye from this period to his current sound is the most remarkable aspect of Ye's career. The purity of Kanye's old soul samples grew into the supersize production on \"Otis.\" And while any track that asks the question \"What if we turn the scat line from ‘Try a Little Tenderness’ into the most relevant rap duet since ‘Da Rockwilder?’\" deserves to move on, homage is due where it is deserved. \"Home\" is a headphone masterpiece, but \"Otis\" is some peak stadium shit.</p> <p> - Mark Cavdar </p>"

				text: "<p>\"Late\" is Kanye's last flirtation with indifference, and as a result, the track is among his most uninhibited and instantly enjoyable, celebrating an appetite for apathy that's been largely absent from his later canon. The refreshing lethargy of the beat creates an undemanding atmosphere that complements some of his most detached and hilariously off-the-cuff one liners, calling out his own carelessness (\"Five hours later, 'I'll be there in five minutes’\"), or even the tedium of his craft (\"I'll be on time for that...I can't think of nothing that can rhyme with that\"). \"Late\"'s strength is its aloofness; it seems nit-picky to fault a song this carefree for being too loose, but the passiveness of his delivery, especially compared to his recent work, makes Ye's attitude seem simulated, and a bit inauthentic.</p> <p>\"Chain Heavy\" is able to replicate the wit and boisterousness of \"Late\" without sacrificing any of its earnestness. Raps about race, vanity, and family are delivered with enough bravado to emphasize the significance of the theme, but enough restraint and humor to create an enjoyable listen. The galactic-inspired Theremin hook courtesy of Q-Tip (delivering some of his best production since Illmatic), serves to offset the seriousness, a technique West used abundantly in the early part of his career, when he still prioritized pop radio play. The modest verse from Talib Kweli, followed by a \"just happy to be there\" Consequence, almost lose me toward the end, but the first half of the track sets a pace so enduring that it simply can't be derailed. </p> <p> - Kyle Fulton </p>"
