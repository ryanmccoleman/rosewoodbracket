That said, \"New Workout Plan\" is too easily dismissed as some gag throwaway song, which overlooks its sly political tone. (Plus, it's a banger. I mean, I've been listening to it on the elliptical for a decade now.) </P><p>Kanye's said before that he wrote the track knowing women—and, let's be honest, many men—listen to his music at the gym. Riffing on that, he made what's one of the best high parodies of the pressures to be the ideal of the \"video girl.\" Should this sound like an apology for a song that encourages women to \"give head, stop breathe, get up, check your weave,\" take a look at the music video. Not only is it remarkably playful and cartoon-like in tone, it features a bit with Tracee Ellis Ross playing a Parisian woman lauding the power of Kanye’s workout tapes. In acting the part of the video girl, she draws attention to this figure, meaning the whole music video, and the song, becomes about what this objectified role means. (Not to mention that the \"New Workout Plan\" video stars Anna Nicole Smith, RIP, the mid-2000s paradigm of mainstream white hetero female hotness.) Then there's looking at the song in the context of Kanye's partnership with Kim Kardashian: an idealized feminine beauty but one with economic and cultural clout that rivals Yeezus' own. Given how Kim K rose to fame (read: sex tape), she's the video girl who became bigger than the video itself and created a new entity: Kimye. Look, I could go on for days. \"New Workout Plan\" for the cultural win. \"Diamonds from Sierra Leone\" for the actual win. </p> <p> - Kiva Reardon </p>"

				text: "<p>I was slow to the MP3 leak game, so I ended up reading a lot about the <em>The College Dropout </em>before I ever heard it. Most of the advanced reviews were similar, hailing West as a dynamic producer with more hooks than Bass Pro, but paying little attention to his ability as a rapper. So when the \"All Falls Down\" music video dropped in early 2004 and I was exposed to Kanye for the first time, I remember being surprised by the stand-out lyricism. I was instantly attracted to the conflicting points of view, and how effortlessly his focus could switch from reflective apprehension (\"And for that paper, look how low we stoop\") to self-assured hubris (\"Fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou\"). The song is a rare example of Ye working things out; uncertain of his angle, but as determined as ever in his delivery.</p> <p>Putting it against \"Spaceship,\" another highlight of the album’s first half, seems fitting, if a little unfair. Centered on a sped-up sample of Marvin Gaye's serene \"Distant Lover,\" \"Spaceship\"’s beat is among Kanye's most measured and soulful, creating a lush and atmospheric instrumental as good as anything on <em>TCD</em>. But the abrasiveness of his raps seem at odds with the composure of the production, and at the end of the day, \"Spaceship\" can't match \"All Falls Down\" in ambition or antagonism, resulting in a work that's thoroughly enjoyable, but unexceptional.</p> <p> - Kyle Fulton </p>"

From the first revelation (\"If this is your first time hearing this, you are about to experience something so cold\"), West is on a calculated mission to convert, announcing each phrase with the gravity of an epiphany, but also the poise to make it clear that this song, and album, are simply an affirmation of his preordained greatness. But what makes this track momentous enough to rank alongside other great album opening manifestos (\"The Ruler’s Back,\" \"Excursions,\" \"Liquid Swords\") isn't its cocksure swagger, but its long term vision. \"We Don't Care\" is his musical prototype, a grand design that he would continue to build and elaborate on over the first half of his career. It's not his best track, rather the genesis of this century's most acclaimed body of art, making it arguably his most important. </p> <p>If \"We Don't Care\" is a candidate for Kanye's most conscientious song, then \"Touch the Sky\" is surely one of his more cursory. It's his \"Diddy track,\" and I mean that in the best way possible. Built around the hook of an established Curtis Mayfield classic, and flush with first-rate rhymes (\"I felt like Bad Boy's street team, I couldn't work the Lox\"), West succeeds in making one of his top radio- friendly tracks, which also ranks among his most one-dimensional. Maybe it’s the safety of the Just Blaze production, or the fact that Lupe Fiasco never lived up to the hype, but \"Touch the Sky\" hasn't aged as well as I would have guessed while watching Kanyevil stunt in 2006 . It's a hit to be sure, but it lacks the audacity of Ye's best work, making it an easy first round upset.</p> <p> - Kyle Fulton </p>"

				text: "<p>Since deciding to share this bracket with the world, one of the thoughts that's continually plagued me has been our decision to knock \"Through the Wire\" out in the first round. As Kanye’s first hit single, \"Through the Wire\"’s greatest legacy is that it was an introduction to a sense of urgency that would come to define so much of Kanye's catalog thereafter. Kanye has never stopped creating like he might die tomorrow, and has never stopped celebrating the fact that he's here today, and \“Through the Wire\” is the perfect juncture of these themes. As important as this idea would become to Kanye's sound over the years, and as immortal as \"a boost for breakfast, an Ensure of dizzert\" is as a line, it's hard to top Kanye talking about his family. In the vast canon of vulnerable-Kanye songs, his \"family songs\" are the ones in which he’s most relatable (\"Roses,\" \"Hey Mama,\" \"Only One\") and \"Family Business\" is best-in-class. I challenge anyone to find a better verse about family dynamics, in the whole history of hip hop, than the second verse of \"Family Business,\" ending with the incredible five-line punch: \"Got roaches at their crib like them your first cousins, Act like you ain't took a bath with your cousins, Fit three in the bed while six of y'all, I'm talkin' 'bout three by the head and three by the leg, But you ain't have to tell my girl I used to pee in the bed.\"</p> <p> - Sal Patel </p>"

No one roots for Goliath, but there is a reason \"Slow Jamz\" feels like it was under-seeded by the selection committee and it proves that by surgically picking apart \"Hey Mama\"'s defense to advance easily into the Round of 32. \"Hey Mama\" should not be sold short—it is a ballad dedicated to Ye's mother, Donda West, and it beautifully describes his affection for her with a raw sentimentality rarely seen in rap. The song took on even more meaning for Ye personally after his mother’s passing a few short years after it’s release. But that personal connection cannot overshadow the importance of \"Jamz\" being Yeezy’s first number one single. Q magazine named it as the nineteenth greatest hip-hop song of all time—hyperbole, yes, but a sign of how beloved it still is within West’s overall catalogue. In many ways, the sped-up soul sample work on \"Jamz\" defines our memory of Kanye’s early sound as an artist, and it's the signature song that put him on the radio/pop landscape. \"She got a light-skinned friend, look like Michael Jackson./ Got a dark-skinned friend, look like Michael Jackson\" is the fast break off-the-glass alley-oop that puts this one out of reach.</p> <p> - Trevor Smith </p>"

After two verses of the Louis Vuitton Don on top, at award shows wearing designer cologne, all glasses are raised. The rapping stops, but the beat continues for Kanye West to tell ‘em the Kanye West story, in detail. He gets evicted and moves with his mom to New Jersey, he tracks \"Heart of the City\" for Jay-Z, he builds some IKEA furniture, his deal falls apart with Capitol records so he makes his home at Roc-A-Fella. The rest is history. Long before he was interrupting award shows, Kanye knew how to thank those who had helped him get to where he was, and man did he know how to use that AKAI sampler.</p> <p> - Daniel Hernandez </p>"

Both \"Coldest Winter\" and \"Stronger\" are a musical mosquito itch, touching on something that’s already there to visceral effect. And while \"Coldest Winter\" achieves an arguably more original sonic picture, \"Stronger\" is as close as Kanye gets to photo-realism. </p> <p>\"Coldest Winter\" is a song about leaving something behind. \"Stronger\" is so present it’s almost prescient. \"Coldest Winter\" asks the listener to linger on an old wound, but \"Stronger\" propels its audience forward. Kanye’s reputation that he doesn’t play well with others has always been belied by his catalogue and while neither \"Coldest Winter\" nor \"Stronger\" refit their respective samples (Tears for Fears’ \"Memories Fade\" and Daft Punk’s \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\") in a particularly dramatic way, both songs exploit the emotional strength of the work they sample to virtuoso cathartic effect. </p> <p>But, while \"Coldest Winter\" is a note-perfect example of Kanye’s ability to craft a stark emotional landscape within a pop song, \"Stronger\" is a relentless reminder that he’s better at creating music you want to listen to than almost anyone else. </p> <p> - Haley Cullingham </p>"

Even though he is talking about stuff that happens in his life that I couldn’t possibly relate to, this song is actually super relatable. \"I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny / And what I do, act more stupidly.\" Like, even if this feeling isn’t followed by me buying hella Louis V, this sentiment is pretty damn universal.</p> <p>\"Good Morning\" is a pretty great way to open up an album.

It also didn’t sound out of place in a preview for a new Scorcese film. </p> <p>\"I’m In It\"’ may have seemed at first little more than a spartan preamble to the album’s massive centrepiece, \"Blood On The Leaves.\" But after living with <em>Yeezus</em> for a few weeks, \"I’m In It\" began to emerge as central to any understanding of <em>Yeezus’</em> bizarre inner logic, a kind of Rosetta Stone uniting the album’s twin poles of racial politics and sexual obsession. This is the song where the wires finally cross, to shocking effect (\"Black girl sippin’ white wine I put my fist in her like a civil rights sign\"). Featuring startling contributions from young producers (Arca, Evian Christ), this song may also be the most successful example to date of Kanye’s increasingly curatorial approach to production. \"My mind moves like a Tron bike,\" Kanye explains. \"Pop a wheelie on the zeitgeist.” \"I’m In It\" is the sound of a man making an impossibly smooth landing.</p> <p> - Rory Lavelle </p>"

The crowning achievement of “Clique” though, is Kanye’s verse, which manages to name drop and stunt on CIA-director George Tenet, reference Kim’s humble (porn) beginnings, and reflect on the ongoing woes of his mother’s passing, all in the span of 80 seconds.

On the other hand, \"White Dress\" is a love letter. Kanye describes his now-betrothed and envisions their future together; the song is definitely sweet, and yet it contains a twinge of melancholia. The piano-heavy accompaniment is smooth and simple; the resulting effect is one of nostalgia. In many ways, \"White Dress\" is uncharacteristic; it is a departure from Kanye's typical lavish, layered musical productions.

Appearing after a rather shallow track, “Drunk and Hot Girls,” Ye does what he does best on “FL” and plays with the contrasts and dichotomy of his image.

The cadences and chord voicings of the synthetic choir, plucked straight from the canon of classical composition, sound right at home among the robotic bleeps and bloops of Kanye’s new soundworld.

He admits this, but in a poignant turn he bares the mask and reveals that it’s all just posturing; he’s a broken person, insecure and fearful of the titular abandonment.

He knows how impudent he is to try and interpolate perhaps the most important and revered song about racism in American Pop Music history for the purposes of singing a breakup anthem...about your mistress...and an aborted love-child...in auto-tune. The gall of that tightrope walk is breathtaking, and the power of that juxtaposition and its audaciousness borders on blasphemous without tipping over the edge. This is not lost on the listener and it is what powers “Blood on the Leaves” and its towering horns to a victory over “So Appalled.” “Appalled” is a great, great posse cut. Memorable lines abound (and the track features some of the best work from both Jay and Pusha in years), but “Blood” may be the definitive example of what has made Ye the most iconoclastic artist of his era, which should be more than enough to edge out a victory and advance to the Sweet 16. </p> <p> - Trevor Smith </p>"

The musicality added to the mix by Charlie Wilson’s incredible gospel-register juxtaposed with the atmospheric and alien Swizz Beatz production, elevate “Lord, Lord, Lord” to a much higher place. Mos Def ponders his relationship with Islam, taking the song’s subject matter most literally of the four emcees, and delivering his best verse, to this day, since <em>The Ecstatic</em>. Raekwon the Chef continues to be the hood poet with a lyrical paint brush, managing to close the song with vivid scene after scene of luxe in the ghetto. The only weak part of this song, and question mark for the history books, is why Kanye decided to include Swizz Beatz’s ode to whackness. This wrinkle in “Lord, Lord, Lord”’s armour, explains how 2012 monster “Mercy” has no trouble taking this match-up. On “Mercy,” each of Pusha, Tittyboi and Ye are competitive and fierce, turning-up successively and excessively. Even Big Sean, who was otherwise in his corn-ball era, delivers a highly quoted and breezy verse. But most importantly, the song was most of the world’s introduction to 2Chainz, who steals the show with his everyman swag. While Kanye boasts of throwing “suicides on the private jet,” Tittyboi is just happy to be drinking champagne in coach on his domestic flight.

So it’s interesting that two of its more reserved tracks have made it deep in a conference defined by grandiosity. Sequenced later in the album, “Everything I Am” builds on “Can't Tell Me Nothing”’s established themes of confusion and apprehension, but rather than doubling down on the big questions, West changes gears, boiling down all his self doubts to a simple case of “haters gon hate.” On first listen, the song is as heartwarmingly old-school as anything in Ye's early period, with its <em>Finding Forever</em> B-side beat, and shouts to Native Tongues, all accented with Premier scratches. It's the wholesome simplicity of the production that provokes the listener to go looking for modesty, and maybe a deeper insight into the artist's point of view. But after a few bars it becomes clear that short of a public denunciation of mink boots, Kanye isn't going to give you much to work with. Still, self pity always looked surprisingly good on Yeezy, and despite its slightly conceited tone, “Everything I Am” shows flashes of how brilliantly funny he can be when he assumes the role of the underdog (\"People talk so much shit about me in barbershops, they forget to get their haircut”). Against a lesser rival, this might be a closer finish, but in this tournament “Everything I Am” will have to be satisfied with the \"I got a lot of cheese\" award.</p><p>- Kyle Fulton</p>"

You knew what this was from the jump, so, as Pusha T spits heartlessly, “pick your next move, you can leave or live with it.”  The juxtaposition of this sentiment and the idea that Kanye is “so gifted at finding what [he does not] like the most” amount to a relationship as painted by MC Escher: stairs that lead nowhere and everywhere; an exquisite diagram of impending emotional doom.

Have you ever seen the video of the first time Kanye played the beat for “Last Call” for Jay-Z? It’s like watching a man eat a properly cooked steak for the first time.  “Last Call” is the moment you learn that the master chef is great in front of a camera. It’s a realization of the many facets of nascent genius. </p> <p>”Jesus Walks” is a triumph when considered in isolation, but when compared with “Last Call” its gravitas is jaw dropping. This is the same man from the previous track, but rather than sprinting to the stage, this Kanye prowls the boards ferociously, converting atheists (and doubters) into believers. Kanye needs Jesus the way that Kathy Lee needed Regis, which raises the question: is Yeezy really on this God tip, or is he looking for a comic foil who just happened to go to Notre Dame? Perhaps that doesn’t matter. Perhaps the veracity of Kanye’s piousness is of secondary importance.  Perhaps this Kanye, who gasps for air amidst choking detectives, who spits furiously over multi-track violins, perhaps this Kanye transcends the man who couldn’t get a record deal. “Jesus Walks” is Kanye, no longer entombed in the studio, ascended to the stage, sitting on his throne for all time.  Jesus may have been the Prince of Peace, but “Jesus Walks” murders this match up. This is Kanye risen. </p> <p>- Rob Kraszewski </p>"

				text: "<p>\"Say You Will\" is surprisingly heartbreaking given its lack of lyrical content; Kanye's state of desperation shines through the textured rhythm. The three-minute outro teases us as much as his ex does him, and we can't help but want something more.  Though there are few things more satisfying than hearing that Major 6th chord play underneath Kanye's \"hey hey hey hey,\" \"Can't Tell Me Nothing\" comes out victorious in the end. \"Can't Tell Me Nothing\" is 20% self-deprecating and 80% unapologetic; it is somehow a for-the-people confidence booster, yet a wildly unrelatable piece about fame and extravagance at the same time. The production of \"Can't Tell Me Nothing\" seems to support and mimic the lyrics (the rising \"Oh\" climbing in pitch just as Kanye climbs in self-assurance, for example), a rare and genius musical feat. Kanye has said that both \"Say You Will\" and \"Can't Tell Me Nothing\" are two of his favorite songs of his own; we agree but ultimately pick the latter. </p> <p> - Sonali Mehta </p>"

				text: "<p>I've always associated the ending of \"Runaway\" with <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>, because Kanye sounds like HAL 9000 when he's winding down. Except that instead of croaking about a bicycle built for two, he's reiterating all the reasons that he's liable to end up alone. We've heard them several times before over the course of the song, except now the syllables are blurred into a buzzing nothingness—the sound of a brainstem come unplugged. This shift from confessional clarity to Auto Tuned abstraction is gradual, because \"Runaway\"is unusually long—nine minutes and eight seconds—which in turn gives listeners time to appreciate the (Kubrickian) complexity of its production: icy piano plunks under-laid with a chugging drum machine, judicious strings and subtly multi-tracked vocals on the chorus. (Pusha T's guest verse is like a built-in sound effect—the Clipse MC’s voice is like a cold scalpel slicing through warm synths).  The same is true of \"Blood on the Leaves,\" which is a little shorter and more spare but similarly massive in its conception. The samples of Nina Simone singing lines from \"Strange Fruit\" have the same nagging, repetitive effect as the ivory-tickling riff in \"Runaway,\" and the moment when the delicacy of the early verses falls away and the brass instruments kick in full force is exhilarating, a marvelous example of set-em-up and knock-em-down. Both songs are brilliantly constructed and uniquely cinematic—they go widescreen where so much hip-hop settles for hand-held—and choosing between them is agonizing. What puts finally \"Runaway\" over the top is its absolutely crystalline integration of form and content —the way it puts an epic frame around the narrator's already inflated self-pity.  \"Blood on the Leaves\" is surely the more audacious track, mixing the imagery of lynching with baby-mama drama (\"your pastor said you can't abort that\"). In doing so, it dares the listener to call bullshit, and maybe that's ultimately the right call.  But \"Runaway\" isn't a stunt or a gambit. Rather, it's a guy owning up to the fact that he's an asshole (and a douchebag, and a scumbag) and finding the verbal and musical language along the way to make that admission funny, resonant and beautiful. \"Blood on the Leaves\" is great precisely because it's debatable, but \"Runaway\" is undeniable. </p> <p> - Adam Nayman </p>"

				text: "<p>A few months ago at karaoke, my friend Perry selected \"Try a Little Tenderness\" and I realized with shame that I can't even hear the song in its original form anymore. As soon as he got to \"Love is their own happy ending\" I instinctively wanted to chime in, \"Sounds so soulful, don't you agree?\" which, while not inaccurate—Perry, if you're reading this, you're a good singer—still seemed to me extremely perverse. \"Otis\" is a tribute that runs lovingly roughshod over its subject, interrupting the intricate melody of the original song for a couple of booming victory laps over lyrical terrain that Jay and Ye have covered before: American hustle (\"Not bad huh/for some immigrants\"); big-living largesse (\"Last week I was in my other other Benz\") and the glad-handing piousness of multimillionaires who never lost their persecution complexes (\"Pray that all of their pain be champagne.\"). And it's great, of course—one of the twin peaks of <em>Watch the Throne</em>, along with \"N***** in Paris,” which hijacks lines from a slightly less estimable artist  (Will Ferrell). \"Mercy\" is a boaster's paradise as well, with Kanye, Pusha T, Big Sean and 2 Chainz bragging their asses off, and it's fun enough for all that, but listening to it in 2015, the dancehall samples merely point forward to their more focused application on <em>Yeezus</em>, while the switch-the-beat tactics in the back half—that late Swerve into EDM—only adds to the sense of a song that's been cobbled together. \"Mercy\" is all over the place, and that's part of its excitement, but \"Otis\" is such a tight, brilliantly integrated piece of beat-making that it overwhelms even Otis Redding. It's a dubious achievement worth celebrating.</P> <p> - Adam Nayman</p>"

				text: "<p>Every now and then, I wonder how “Jesus Walks” managed to become a hit record. When it dropped in 2004, there was nothing like it on the radio. The charts that year were dominated by Lil Jon and Scott Storch productions, and easy hooks by Usher, Ludacris and Fat Joe. But there was Kanye, in the middle of all that crunk, with a production so epic it couldn’t help but get your attention. Militaristic drums, spirited church choirs, snake-charmer keyboards, and swirling strings made \"Jesus Walks” the strangest thing to spill out car windows in the summer of 2004, let alone the speakers at the club (where Kanye preordained he’d have people screaming out). </p><p> He was right. The clubs were lit-up with people, leaning-back and doing the rock-away, suddenly singing about Jesus walking with them. The epic medium and delivery of the song—including its three music videos, two remixes and massive televised performances—perhaps distracted, at the time, from the song’s lyrical dynamism. Lines such as “Like Kathy Lee need Regis” aside, “Jesus Walks” is about finding your courage wolf—the thing that gives you strength and resolve for each ounce of belief you pour into it. Kanye’s worship of Jesus is what allowed him to rise above his near-death accident, face the music and the haters, and arrive in your headphones, speakers, and clubs. </p><p>But in 2015, we know very well that Jesus comes second to Yeezus in Kanye’s narrative. \"Kanye has made the act of being himself into his magnum opus,\" Charles Bramesco recently said. And this is why “Can’t Tell Me Nothing” with its self-prophesizing lines—“I’m on TV talkin like it’s just you and me,” “don’t ever fix your lips like collagen, and say something when you gon’ end up apologin’”—is ultimately the more important song when it comes to explaining his idiosyncratic pop culture identity, an identity without which we wouldn’t have albums like <em>808s</em>, <em>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</em> and <em>Yeezus</em>. “I told God I’d be back in a second,” he chants, hearkening back to “Jesus Walks”—let’s hope God isn’t holding his breath.</p> <p> - Sal Patel </p>"

				text: "<p>”My life is dope and I do dope shit.” Back in 2013 Kanye's mantra sounded too good to be true coming from Dave Chappelle on late night television, but really, this paraphrased self assessment was hardly a revelation. Kanye has long been a champion of living well, and with “Otis,” perhaps the liveliest track of his career, he takes this theme to new levels of chutzpah, with his mentor riding shotgun. “Otis” doesn't come close to breaking new ground in the Kanye catalogue; the Stax Records sample, Jay-Z verse, and explicit details of the “good life” are all well-trodden. But, despite the humdrum of its familiarity, “Otis” executes West’s tried and tested method with such excellent results that you can forgive a return to old tricks. Jay and Kanye's back forth rapping is delivered with a wit and breeziness seldom seen since Tip and Phife, while the chopped up “Try a Little Tenderness” sample is as easy on the ears as anything post-<em>Late Registration</em>. The track's buoyant exuberance is inspired by nostalgia, certainly, but it is also fuelled by the jovial bliss one can only experience while doing doughnuts in a destroyed Maybach filled with models and Aziz Ansari. Yup, being dope is dope. </P> <p>While “Otis” is a reminder of the fun you can have playing with house money (those Redding samples don't come cheap, yo) “Runaway” is the payout from one of Kanye’s greatest longshots. The fool-hardy charisma and charm we’ve come to love has been chipped away, and what’s left is an artist at his most naked and lonely. For just over 9 minutes, Kanye rejects the warm insulation of his own bravado, and now, frigid and fading from exposure, there’s nothing left to do but repent. This vulnerability can at times seem needlessly challenging, but it can also give a single piano key punch more weight and emotion than anything John Legend has ever played, or make a “toast to the douchebags” sound like a profound manifesto. “Runaway” isn’t the way we want to see Kanye, but it might be his best look.</p> <p> -Kyle Fulton </p>"

				text: "<p>Sal:</p><p>One of the limitations we’ve found in measuring Kanye songs against one another is that it's forced an inherently insular dialogue around the merits of one song versus another, when the fact is that “Kanye West The Cultural Figure” is the most important part of Kanye's post-<em>808s</em> music.  </p><p>On <em>College Dropout</em> and <em>Late Registration</em>, Kanye was hell-bent on making conscious rap music cool and accessible. And while some onlookers already saw a fascinating hypocrisy developing in the so-called “backpack rapper” with a Louis Vuitton backpack’s public image, the music was still paramount. By the time <em>Graduation</em> came around, Kanye had just come off tour supporting U2, and achieving “stadium status” was on his mind. All he wanted now was to make songs that crowds could sing along to—a universal soundtrack to people’s lives. The result was an album about half as lyrically dense as anything he’d done before, and with a lowest-common-denominator approach to song-writing (“Good Life,” “Stronger”). And it worked. 2007’s Glow In the Dark tour was the biggest and most elaborate tour in hip hop history. Fast-forward one year and, on the heels of his mother’s passing and the worst break-up of his life, he turned the camera around for the first time, and truly made himself the text. The 2007 /2008 dichotomy in West’s oeuvre is the most important to understand his art. It set a template of an artist struggling to achieve universal appeal out of telling his own story. </p><p>Kyle:</p><p>If Kanye were a painter, his greatest masterpieces would be his self portraits. So maybe it’s unsurprising that it’s come down to \"Can't Tell Me Nothing\"  and \"Runaway,\" both constant reminders that West is at his most honest, significant and beautiful when he's on his Rembrandt. By starting with the man in the mirror, West creates a dichotomy that’s harder to find in his less introspective works. Both tracks are fearless, but vulnerable, resolute but still in search of affirmation. It’s this disunion that makes both cuts so integral.</p><p>Sal:</p><p>Both aim to get you screaming back from the rafters, with lines like “Wait til I get my money right,” and “Let’s have a toast to the douchebags,” but are also so specific to Kanye’s public persona, “I’m on TV talkin’ like it’s just you and me,” “I’m so gifted at findin’ what I don’t like the most.” This is what makes these songs so important, their unique ability to create concurrently universal and intimate moments. </p><p>”Can’t Tell Me Nothing” does this over one of the dopest trap beats ever conceived. Let’s take a minute to give DJ Toomp his due here, and then take the praise back to Kanye for tapping the southern legend, who was otherwise mostly known for underground T.I. cuts. Its cinematic sound is one that still shakes me, and the decision to pair it with Australian pop singer Connie Mitchell’s looped vocals, and Jeezy’s turn-up ad-libs, is signature Kanye—making magic out of non sequitur. </p><p>Kyle:</p><p>If this were a competition of the bangers, or a salute to Kanye at his “Dopest,” then “Can’t Tell Me Nothing” would be an easy victor. Lyrically, its Yeezy’s alltime best; self assured, accessible and beautifully brash. When he opens with the revelation “I had a dream I could buy my way to heaven, when I awoke I spent that on a necklace,” you know you’re in for something equally sidesplitting and heartbreaking. This is what dropping 40 points in the fourth quarter looks like. </P><p>But at the end of the day, The Rosewood Bracket was designed to determine Kanye’s greatest song. A track that has transcended rap, and goes beyond what we previously thought possible from a dude from the Chi with a Benz and a backpack. A cut equally at home in the club, Wembley Stadium, the coffee shop, or the suicide-doored tour bus. A joint for the good days and the bad. For these reasons it has to be “Runaway.”</p> <p>“Can’t Tell Me Nothing” started with a dream, not a plan. Kanye West, the rapper, knew he’d seen the light, but it was still unfocused, and not ready to be included in the grand design. But 4 years later, Kanye West, the rapper, the singer, the producer, the performer, the designer and artist, stood on stage in fire red Versace and told us “Baby, I got a plan.” It was clear he believed it. And we believed it too.</P>"
