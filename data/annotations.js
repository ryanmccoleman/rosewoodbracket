That said, \"New Workout Plan\" is too easily dismissed as some gag throwaway song, which overlooks its sly political tone. (Plus, it's a banger. I mean, I've been listening to it on the elliptical for a decade now.) </P><p>Kanye's said before that he wrote the track knowing women—and, let's be honest, many men—listen to his music at the gym. Riffing on that, he made what's one of the best high parodies of the pressures to be the ideal of the \"video girl.\" Should this sound like an apology for a song that encourages women to \"give head, stop breathe, get up, check your weave,\" take a look at the music video. Not only is it remarkably playful and cartoon-like in tone, it features a bit with Tracee Ellis Ross playing a Parisian woman lauding the power of Kanye’s workout tapes. In acting the part of the video girl, she draws attention to this figure, meaning the whole music video, and the song, becomes about what this objectified role means. (Not to mention that the \"New Workout Plan\" video stars Anna Nicole Smith, RIP, the mid-2000s paradigm of mainstream white hetero female hotness.) Then there's looking at the song in the context of Kanye's partnership with Kim Kardashian: an idealized feminine beauty but one with economic and cultural clout that rivals Yeezus' own. Given how Kim K rose to fame (read: sex tape), she's the video girl who became bigger than the video itself and created a new entity: Kimye. Look, I could go on for days. \"New Workout Plan\" for the cultural win. \"Diamonds from Sierra Leone\" for the actual win. </p> <p> - Kiva Reardon </p>"

				text: "<p>I was slow to the MP3 leak game, so I ended up reading a lot about the <em>The College Dropout </em>before I ever heard it. Most of the advanced reviews were similar, hailing West as a dynamic producer with more hooks than Bass Pro, but paying little attention to his ability as a rapper. So when the \"All Falls Down\" music video dropped in early 2004 and I was exposed to Kanye for the first time, I remember being surprised by the stand-out lyricism. I was instantly attracted to the conflicting points of view, and how effortlessly his focus could switch from reflective apprehension (\"And for that paper, look how low we stoop\") to self-assured hubris (\"Fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou\"). The song is a rare example of Ye working things out; uncertain of his angle, but as determined as ever in his delivery.</p> <p>Putting it against \"Spaceship,\" another highlight of the album’s first half, seems fitting, if a little unfair. Centered on a sped-up sample of Marvin Gaye's serene \"Distant Lover,\" \"Spaceship\"’s beat is among Kanye's most measured and soulful, creating a lush and atmospheric instrumental as good as anything on <em>TCD</em>. But the abrasiveness of his raps seem at odds with the composure of the production, and at the end of the day, \"Spaceship\" can't match \"All Falls Down\" in ambition or antagonism, resulting in a work that's thoroughly enjoyable, but unexceptional.</p> <p> - Kyle Fulton </p>"

From the first revelation (\"If this is your first time hearing this, you are about to experience something so cold\"), West is on a calculated mission to convert, announcing each phrase with the gravity of an epiphany, but also the poise to make it clear that this song, and album, are simply an affirmation of his preordained greatness. But what makes this track momentous enough to rank alongside other great album opening manifestos (\"The Ruler’s Back,\" \"Excursions,\" \"Liquid Swords\") isn't its cocksure swagger, but its long term vision. \"We Don't Care\" is his musical prototype, a grand design that he would continue to build and elaborate on over the first half of his career. It's not his best track, rather the genesis of this century's most acclaimed body of art, making it arguably his most important. </p> <p>If \"We Don't Care\" is a candidate for Kanye's most conscientious song, then \"Touch the Sky\" is surely one of his more cursory. It's his \"Diddy track,\" and I mean that in the best way possible. Built around the hook of an established Curtis Mayfield classic, and flush with first-rate rhymes (\"I felt like Bad Boy's street team, I couldn't work the Lox\"), West succeeds in making one of his top radio- friendly tracks, which also ranks among his most one-dimensional. Maybe it’s the safety of the Just Blaze production, or the fact that Lupe Fiasco never lived up to the hype, but \"Touch the Sky\" hasn't aged as well as I would have guessed while watching Kanyevil stunt in 2006 . It's a hit to be sure, but it lacks the audacity of Ye's best work, making it an easy first round upset.</p> <p> - Kyle Fulton </p>"

				text: "<p>Since deciding to share this bracket with the world, one of the thoughts that's continually plagued me has been our decision to knock \"Through the Wire\" out in the first round. As Kanye’s first hit single, \"Through the Wire\"’s greatest legacy is that it was an introduction to a sense of urgency that would come to define so much of Kanye's catalog thereafter. Kanye has never stopped creating like he might die tomorrow, and has never stopped celebrating the fact that he's here today, and \“Through the Wire\” is the perfect juncture of these themes. As important as this idea would become to Kanye's sound over the years, and as immortal as \"a boost for breakfast, an Ensure of dizzert\" is as a line, it's hard to top Kanye talking about his family. In the vast canon of vulnerable-Kanye songs, his \"family songs\" are the ones in which he’s most relatable (\"Roses,\" \"Hey Mama,\" \"Only One\") and \"Family Business\" is best-in-class. I challenge anyone to find a better verse about family dynamics, in the whole history of hip hop, than the second verse of \"Family Business,\" ending with the incredible five-line punch: \"Got roaches at their crib like them your first cousins, Act like you ain't took a bath with your cousins, Fit three in the bed while six of y'all, I'm talkin' 'bout three by the head and three by the leg, But you ain't have to tell my girl I used to pee in the bed.\"</p> <p> - Sal Patel </p>"

No one roots for Goliath, but there is a reason \"Slow Jamz\" feels like it was under-seeded by the selection committee and it proves that by surgically picking apart \"Hey Mama\"'s defense to advance easily into the Round of 32. \"Hey Mama\" should not be sold short—it is a ballad dedicated to Ye's mother, Donda West, and it beautifully describes his affection for her with a raw sentimentality rarely seen in rap. The song took on even more meaning for Ye personally after his mother’s passing a few short years after it’s release. But that personal connection cannot overshadow the importance of \"Jamz\" being Yeezy’s first number one single. Q magazine named it as the nineteenth greatest hip-hop song of all time—hyperbole, yes, but a sign of how beloved it still is within West’s overall catalogue. In many ways, the sped-up soul sample work on \"Jamz\" defines our memory of Kanye’s early sound as an artist, and it's the signature song that put him on the radio/pop landscape. \"She got a light-skinned friend, look like Michael Jackson./ Got a dark-skinned friend, look like Michael Jackson\" is the fast break off-the-glass alley-oop that puts this one out of reach.</p> <p> - Trevor Smith </p>"

After two verses of the Louis Vuitton Don on top, at award shows wearing designer cologne, all glasses are raised. The rapping stops, but the beat continues for Kanye West to tell ‘em the Kanye West story, in detail. He gets evicted and moves with his mom to New Jersey, he tracks \"Heart of the City\" for Jay-Z, he builds some IKEA furniture, his deal falls apart with Capitol records so he makes his home at Roc-A-Fella. The rest is history. Long before he was interrupting award shows, Kanye knew how to thank those who had helped him get to where he was, and man did he know how to use that AKAI sampler.</p> <p> - Daniel Hernandez </p>"

Both \"Coldest Winter\" and \"Stronger\" are a musical mosquito itch, touching on something that’s already there to visceral effect. And while \"Coldest Winter\" achieves an arguably more original sonic picture, \"Stronger\" is as close as Kanye gets to photo-realism. </p> <p>\"Coldest Winter\" is a song about leaving something behind. \"Stronger\" is so present it’s almost prescient. \"Coldest Winter\" asks the listener to linger on an old wound, but \"Stronger\" propels its audience forward. Kanye’s reputation that he doesn’t play well with others has always been belied by his catalogue and while neither \"Coldest Winter\" nor \"Stronger\" refit their respective samples (Tears for Fears’ \"Memories Fade\" and Daft Punk’s \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\") in a particularly dramatic way, both songs exploit the emotional strength of the work they sample to virtuoso cathartic effect. </p> <p>But, while \"Coldest Winter\" is a note-perfect example of Kanye’s ability to craft a stark emotional landscape within a pop song, \"Stronger\" is a relentless reminder that he’s better at creating music you want to listen to than almost anyone else. </p> <p> - Haley Cullingham </p>"

Even though he is talking about stuff that happens in his life that I couldn’t possibly relate to, this song is actually super relatable. \"I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny / And what I do, act more stupidly.\" Like, even if this feeling isn’t followed by me buying hella Louis V, this sentiment is pretty damn universal.</p> <p>\"Good Morning\" is a pretty great way to open up an album.

It also didn’t sound out of place in a preview for a new Scorcese film. </p> <p>\"I’m In It\"’ may have seemed at first little more than a spartan preamble to the album’s massive centrepiece, \"Blood On The Leaves.\" But after living with <em>Yeezus</em> for a few weeks, \"I’m In It\" began to emerge as central to any understanding of <em>Yeezus’</em> bizarre inner logic, a kind of Rosetta Stone uniting the album’s twin poles of racial politics and sexual obsession. This is the song where the wires finally cross, to shocking effect (\"Black girl sippin’ white wine I put my fist in her like a civil rights sign\"). Featuring startling contributions from young producers (Arca, Evian Christ), this song may also be the most successful example to date of Kanye’s increasingly curatorial approach to production. \"My mind moves like a Tron bike,\" Kanye explains. \"Pop a wheelie on the zeitgeist.” \"I’m In It\" is the sound of a man making an impossibly smooth landing.</p> <p> - Rory Lavelle </p>"

The crowning achievement of “Clique” though, is Kanye’s verse, which manages to name drop and stunt on CIA-director George Tenet, reference Kim’s humble (porn) beginnings, and reflect on the ongoing woes of his mother’s passing, all in the span of 80 seconds.

On the other hand, \"White Dress\" is a love letter. Kanye describes his now-betrothed and envisions their future together; the song is definitely sweet, and yet it contains a twinge of melancholia. The piano-heavy accompaniment is smooth and simple; the resulting effect is one of nostalgia. In many ways, \"White Dress\" is uncharacteristic; it is a departure from Kanye's typical lavish, layered musical productions.

Appearing after a rather shallow track, “Drunk and Hot Girls,” Ye does what he does best on “FL” and plays with the contrasts and dichotomy of his image. The musical buildup in each verse takes shoes, cars, and an easy life of hors d’oeuvres and slams you back to the dark backdrop of the burden accompanying fame.

You think he just wants to tell about first class and champagne? Please, he’s got a “memory museum” and even a gd homonym when he mentions roam and Caesar (Rome?!). You can’t hear this stuff and not want to rewind and appreciate. </p> <p> - Scott Ladley </p>"

				text: "<p> <em>Graduation</em> arrived, with great fanfare, as the culmination of Kanye’s worldly ambitions, a triumphant arrival at a pre-ordained destination. The third album in an ambitious trilogy was bound to be a celebration, a vindication, and an acknowledgement of just how far he had come. “Good Life” stands as an expert paean to decadence, as an exultant Kanye looks back wistfully at his early yearning for success.</p><p>We couldn’t know it then, but for ‘Ye, new yearnings were brewing. From the first track of <em>808s</em>, it was clear that his focus had shifted: now that the music world had been conquered, Kanye would be wrestling with himself. A new drama required new sounds: Auto-Tune and glacial synths would soon become hallmarks of his style, but against the lush background of his earlier work they sounded shockingly alien. “Say You Will” was a mission statement, a note-to-self as Kanye braced for his next bold departure. </p> <p>Of course, none of this would amount to much without Kanye’s innate musicality. The cadences and chord voicings of the synthetic choir, plucked straight from the canon of classical composition, sound right at home among the robotic bleeps and bloops of Kanye’s new soundworld. Listening to “Say You Will” in 2015, you can almost hear the germ of Kanye’s future work in the empty spaces between the notes.</p> <p> - Rory Lavelle </p>"

				text: "<p>“Dark Fantasy” boldly announces that Kanye West’s fifth album <em>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</em> is his great leap forward, but “Runaway” is the album’s centrepiece and the masterpiece recording in one of the most revolutionary discographies in modern pop music. The eclectic production begins with single piano notes that illicit <em>Eyes Wide Shut</em> spine chills and ends in the moving death of android Kanye obscured by the density of his emotions. Kanye West doesn’t want to make great rap music; he wants to be make<em> Kid A</em>, he wants to make <em>Sgt. Pepper’s</em>. But it’s the lyrics of “Runaway” that make this his essential track. Kanye West has always agreed with the haters, he is an asshole. “Runaway” is an unapologetic toast to the world’s douchebags, assholes, and scumbags. We all put up with his shit and sing along. He admits this, but in a poignant turn he bares the mask and reveals that it’s all just posturing; he’s a broken person, insecure and fearful of the titular abandonment. He belongs to the same vain and materialistic world as Kardashians, but in this age of vacuous celebrities, he consistently exhibits self-awareness, self-criticism, and most importantly, sincerity. </p> <p> - Daniel Hernandez </p> "

				text: "<p>There are days when I convince myself  that \"I'm In It\" is one of Kanye's most fully realized and perfectly complex works. And then there are days when I think it’s just a really good song about fucking. What's certain is that \"I'm In It,\" the most challenging track on West's most challenging album, demands more of its audience than any other in the his catalogue, consistently striving to weed out the agnostics. But for those determined to struggle through the initial disharmony, the rewards are abundant. Behind the abject imagery of the lyrics, there’s a stunning refinement to the track, with West balancing the afflictive themes with some of his most visceral and striking production. </p> <p>Similarly, \"New Slaves\" falls into the category of songs that I admire for their veracity, but would still rather not play when my mom is in the car. It is West at his most authentic self; truculent to the point of alienation, but so relevant that you can’t bring yourself to press fast forward. As discordant as it is compelling, it’s more at home projected 30 feet high on the side of Wrigley Field then it is on HOT 97, and likely that was the design all along.</p> <p> - Kyle Fulton </p>"

				text: "<p>A roaring, distorted intro. Tribal, stripped-down beats. Ugly, pulsating synthesizers. “Monster” may just be Kanye’s most appropriately-named song. The numerous guest features only augment the feeling that you’re coming up against a posse of the most vicious and ruthless creatures you’ll ever have the displeasure of encountering. Rick Ross, Jay-Z, and Justin Vernon bear their monstrous selves, but it’s Nicki Minaj and her Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde-esque dueling personas that hog the spotlight like a predator with its prey hanging from its fangs. The piano-driven “Blame Game” finds itself on the other end of the Yeezy spectrum. Kanye drops this crumbling heartbreak of a song with an edge of unchecked angst, and John Legend’s chorus drowns it in even more sorrow. But it’s guaranteed the win when Chris Rock shows up unexpectedly and delivers a skit that will probably go down as one of the funniest moments of Kanye’s career. There’s a reason the words “Yeezy Taught Me” found their way onto girls’ clothes and ultimately into the annals of pop culture, and that reason is “Blame Game.”</p> <p> - Sahil Parikh </p>"

				text: "<p>“Blood on the Leaves” is arguably not only the emotional climax of the album <em>Yeezus</em>, but in some ways it is could be seen as the climax of Kanye’s entire post-<em>Graduation</em> period. This song is Ye’s most beautiful dark and twisted fantasy, a nightmarescape of pain, sadness, and self-doubt. The Kanye we meet here feels betrayed and is full of self-pity and self-righteousness in equal measure, but he also knows exactly what he is doing. He knows how impudent he is to try and interpolate perhaps the most important and revered song about racism in American Pop Music history for the purposes of singing a breakup anthem...about your mistress...and an aborted love-child...in auto-tune. The gall of that tightrope walk is breathtaking, and the power of that juxtaposition and its audaciousness borders on blasphemous without tipping over the edge. This is not lost on the listener and it is what powers “Blood on the Leaves” and its towering horns to a victory over “So Appalled.” “Appalled” is a great, great posse cut. Memorable lines abound (and the track features some of the best work from both Jay and Pusha in years), but “Blood” may be the definitive example of what has made Ye the most iconoclastic artist of his era, which should be more than enough to edge out a victory and advance to the Sweet 16. </p> <p> - Trevor Smith </p>"

				text: "<p>There’s something about the moment that Kanye’s verse kicks-off on 2010 joint “Lord, Lord, Lord”, that immediately sets the song apart from his other GOOD Friday releases. The song is technically structured like a “posse cut” - four emcees, successively spitting over a minimal loop. Yet, \"posse-cut” feels like a misnomer. The musicality added to the mix by Charlie Wilson’s incredible gospel-register juxtaposed with the atmospheric and alien Swizz Beatz production, elevate “Lord, Lord, Lord” to a much higher place. Mos Def ponders his relationship with Islam, taking the song’s subject matter most literally of the four emcees, and delivering his best verse, to this day, since <em>The Ecstatic</em>. Raekwon the Chef continues to be the hood poet with a lyrical paint brush, managing to close the song with vivid scene after scene of luxe in the ghetto. The only weak part of this song, and question mark for the history books, is why Kanye decided to include Swizz Beatz’s ode to whackness. This wrinkle in “Lord, Lord, Lord”’s armour, explains how 2012 monster “Mercy” has no trouble taking this match-up. On “Mercy,” each of Pusha, Tittyboi and Ye are competitive and fierce, turning-up successively and excessively. Even Big Sean, who was otherwise in his corn-ball era, delivers a highly quoted and breezy verse. But most importantly, the song was most of the world’s introduction to 2Chainz, who steals the show with his everyman swag. While Kanye boasts of throwing “suicides on the private jet,” Tittyboi is just happy to be drinking champagne in coach on his domestic flight. That Kanye saw a germ of greatness in Chainz and gave him this early platform, will be one of “Mercy”’s all time legacies.</p> <p>- Sal Patel</p>"

It's a subtle reminder that next to him, everyone else is an opening act.</p> <p>I wanted to like “Clique” more than I do.

That pounding beat, the clash of howls, and the undeniable superiority of Frank Ocean over Big Sean add up to give it depth and range that “Clique” doesn’t offer.

But there’s just no denying the penultimate production and signature Kanye playfulness of “Otis.” Reinventing a classic soul song and turning Harlem’s Apollo Theater alumni into Chicago’s own? That’s Kanye’s raw, panting, swag-so-hard essence. You most certainly remember how you felt when you first heard “Otis,” and you most certainly wanted to jump straight out of your chair and astro-glide backwards to Otis Redding’s scream in the final bars. Although thematically there’s nothing groundbreaking being said here (and admittedly, the combined star power of Jay and Ye can at at times be nauseating to think about), “Otis” sinks the buzzer beater on “White Dress” with it’s multimodal soul production and unlimited excess. </p> <p> - Aaron Ries </p>"

And anyway, a song that gets more exciting as you hear it again and again? It’s a capitalist pop music miracle. Thank you Yeezus. (And Jay Hova too.)</p> <p>- Jess Carroll</p>"
